### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex, and I'm an IT security student at TU Darmstadt. I'm passionate about cybersecurity and Linux, and am always looking for new opportunities to expand my skill set.

I have experience with scripting languages such as Python and Bash, and am currently learning Go. I'm confident in my ability to quickly pick up new languages, technologies, and tools.
In addition to my technical skills, I am highly analytical, able to break down complex problems and develop effective solutions.

Currently, I'm seeking a "working student" opportunity in the IT security industry, where I can apply my knowledge and skills to bring value to a team, while also gaining valuable experience.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to connect.
